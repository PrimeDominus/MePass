# MePass

Decentralised Login/Access/Authority/ID People Actually Use

## Brief Considerations

This system must incorporate all of the following:

1. Something that attracts users in large numbers. (One major reason Google/Facebook/Twitter OAuth methods won over OpenID is because of user familiarity and a large number of pre-existing users.)
2. Something a "drunk novice" is prepared and able to use. (One major reason Google/Facebook/OAuth is popular is because something as simple as "Login with Google" is *_stupidly_* easy, though more people these days are getting accustomed to multi-factor authentication.)
3. Something that works on desktop and mobile devices, and on websites and apps, without requiring a user to install a plugin or special software (e.g. MetaMask) other than maybe something simple for a multi-factor authentication process (i.e. something with similar user-interactions as Google Authenticator or WhatsApp Web).
4. Something that manages user credentials securely decentralised without the capacity for traditional centralised third-party "Admins" to view and manage private details. Granular privacy, sharing, and utilisation functions are manageable by ONLY the owner of the "account" or "ID" in accordance with the settings ONLY the owner specifies.
5. Something that attracts traditional business, organisations, and centralised systems to adopt and promote. (Possibly because of easy user-managed interoperability features, and easy system integration.)
6. Interoperable "account" or "ID" features e.g. for any website/app MePass is integrated with, the user can set what and how information can be accessed and utilised.
7. Safe, easy, quick, and effective (i.e. people will actually use it when needed) "account" recovery without dependence on a centralised key store.
8. Something that prevents (and ideally encourages) users against repeatedly entering their private keys.
